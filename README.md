# 2019 Lighthouse Labs 21 Day Coding Challenge
## I will be posting all of the challenges here and the solutions in the index.js file

### Day 1:

CHALLENGE:
Our challenge begins in Codeville, a small but thriving town in Serverside, Canada, where you are the current mayor nearing the end of your first term. Election season is nearing, and this town needs you, so you've decided to run for a second term. However, you need some help to make sure the election and your campaign run smoothly. Enter JavaScript, a coding language sure to help you optimize the many elements of the upcoming election and (hopefully) secure your return as Mayor.

As your election campaign ramps up, you plan to go door to door to talk to the citizens of Codeville. There are quite a few neighbourhoods in Codeville, but lucky for you, we have a dedicated crew of volunteers to help out. Being the fair Mayor that you are, you want to make sure the work is distributed evenly between the team. Let's figure out how many neighbourhoods each volunteer should visit.

Given an array of volunteer names and an array of neighbourhood names, complete the doorToDoor function so that it returns the number of neighbourhoods each volunteer should visit if the work of going door to door is split evenly amongst them.

Examples
Input:

    const volunteers = [
      'Sally',
      'Jake',
      'Brian',
      'Hamid'
    ];


    const neighbourhoods = [
      'Central Valley',
      'Big Mountain',
      'Little Bridge',
      'Bricktown',
      'Brownsville',
      "Paul's Boutique",
      'Clay Park',
      'Fox Nest'
    ];

Output:
2

### Day 2:

Given a question topic, complete a function interviewAnswer(topic) that returns your stance on that particular election issue. The answer should be returned as a string.

When asked about arts funding, the function should return "We'll have to get creative!"
When asked about the economy, the function should return "Time is money."
When asked about transportation, the function should return "It's going to be a long road, so we better get moving."
If you're asked about a topic that isn't in the list above, respond with a default statement. (For example, "QUACK!")

Examples
Input:
const topic = 'economy'
Output:
Time is money.
Input:
const topic = 'transportation'
Output:
It's going to be a long road, so we better get moving.

### Day 3:
Instructions
When a resident casts their vote, the system will be passed the name of the candidate they voted for and the current standings. It will then update the standings, adding the new vote to the count.

To test the system, we'll need to complete the function castVote(name, votes) that takes in the name of a candidate and an array of tallied votes. The function should return an array with the updated standings.

We will be testing the system with three possible candidates: Tim, Sally and Beth. Each item in the votes array represents the number of votes for a particular candidate:

The first item in the array votes[0] are the votes for Tim
The second item in the arry votes[1] are the votes for Sally
The third item in the array votes[2] are the votes for Beth
For example in this array [0, 2, 1] there are 0 votes for Tim, 2 votes for Sally and 1 vote for Beth.

Examples
Input:

    const name = 'Sally';
    const votes = [
      0, // Tim
      2, // Sally
      1 // Beth
    ]

Output:

    [
      0, // Tim
      3, // Sally
      1 // Beth
    ]
Input:

    const name = 'Tim';
    const votes = [
      1, // Tim
      1, // Sally
      2 // Beth
    ];

Output:

    [
      2, // Tim
      1 // Sally
      2 // Beth
    ]
